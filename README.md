## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI Image Detection System** is a web-based application that detects whether an uploaded image is **AI-generated** or **Real (Human-created)**.  
This system uses **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning models** to analyze visual patterns and metadata to make accurate predictions.

With the rise of AI-generated images, this project helps in:
- Identifying fake or synthetic images
- Supporting digital authenticity
- Preventing misuse of AI-generated media

## 🎯 Features
- 📤 Upload an image directly from the browser  
- 🤖 AI-based image classification  
- ⚡ Fast and accurate detection  
- 🖥️ Simple and user-friendly interface  
- 📊 Displays clear result: **AI Generated / Real Image**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### Backend
- Python  
- Machine Learning Model  

### Libraries / Tools
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (model dependent)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Flask / FastAPI (optional for API)

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User uploads an image
2. Image is preprocessed (resize, normalization, etc.)
3. AI model analyzes image patterns
4. System predicts whether the image is:
   - ✅ Real Image  
   - ❌ AI Generated Image
5. Result is displayed on the screen
